- 1.4oz (40g) zucchini
- 1 shiitake mushroom
- 1&frac12; tbsp toasted sesame oil
- 4.9oz (140g) ground beef
- salt and pepper, to taste
- 2 cups (420g) cooked rice

### Toppings (optional)
- toasted sesame oil

- green onion
- roasted seasoned seaweed

## Direction
1. Finely chop the onion, carrot, zucchini, and shiitake mushroom.

2. In a wok (or pot), heat the sesame oil (1&frac12; tbsp) over medium heat. Once it gets nice and hot, add the ground beef, a pinch of salt, and black pepper. Break up the meat and saute for 3min.

3. Once the beef is cooked, add the cooked rice and water (4 cups, 960ml). Bring it to a boil. Once it comes to a boil, add all the veggies and let it continue to boil over medium heat for 7-8min. Stir it occasionally.

4. Add 1 tbsp of dasida (Korean beef stock powder). Taste and add more salt if itâ€™s needed.

5. Once you get the right consistency, divide into serving bowls. Garnish with sesame oil (1 tsp), sesame seeds, green onion, and seasoned seaweed.
