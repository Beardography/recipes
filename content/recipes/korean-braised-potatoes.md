# Korean Braised Potatoes (Gamja Jorim)
## Ingredients
- 1&frac12;lbs potatoes (about 3 medium size)
- 1 carrot (about 3oz)
- 2-3 green chili peppers (or &frac12; green bell pepper)
- &frac14; medium onion

### Braising Liquid
- 3 tbsp soy sauce (or 2 tbsp and 1 tbsp gochujang)
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 1 tbsp rice wine (or mirin)
- 1 tbsp corn syrup
- Pinch black pepper
- &frac34; cup water
- 1 tsp sesame oil
- &frac12; tsp roasted sesame seeds

## Directions
1. Peel and cut potatoes into about 1-inch cubes

2. Cut the carrot, peppers, and onion into big chunks

3. In a small bowl, combine all the braising liquid ingredients except the sesame oil and seeds. Stir well.

4. In a non-stick pan (or a small pot), saute the potatoes in cooking oil over medium heat for 4-5min, stirring occasionally so the potatoes doin't stick to the pan.

5. Add the sauce mix and bring it to a boil over high heat. Drop the carrot pieces in

6. Cover, and reduce the theat to medium and cook until potatoes are almost cooked through (about 5-6min, depending on the type or size of potatoes). The potatoes should be firm and not mushy

7. Stir in the green peppers and onions, and continue to boil (uncover this time) until the sauce is reduced and slightly thickened, about 3min. The potatoes will continue to soak up the sauce even after being cooked.

8. Stir in the sesame oil and sprinkle with sesame seeds.
