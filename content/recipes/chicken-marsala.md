# Chicken Marsala
## Ingredients
- 4 boneless chicken breasts, about 2lbs total
- &frac34; cup all-purpose flour
- 1&frac12; tsp kosher salt, divided, plus more for seasoning
- &frac34; tsp black pepper, divided, plus more for seasoning
- &frac14; cup olive oil
- 2 tsp unsalted butter
- &frac12; cup white onions, finely chopped
- 2 tsp minced garlic
- 4 cups brown mushrooms, &frac12;-inch thick slices
- &frac12; cup marsala wine, sweet
- &frac12; cup unsalted chicken stock
- &frac12; cup heavy whipping cream
- 1 tbsp chopped parsley

## Directions
1. Place one of the chicken pieces between two plastic sheets or in a large plastic bag. Flatten to an even thickness, about &frac12;-inch thick. Repeat with the remaining pieces.

2. Alternatively, for pieces larger than 1-inch thick and heavier than 8oz, cut in half horizontally. This should create eight &frac12;-inch thick pieces.

3. In a medium bowl, combine flour, 1tsp salt, and &frac12;tsp pepper. Set aside.

4. Lightly season each side of the chicken breast with salt and pepper. Dredge the pieces in the seasoned flour, shaking off any excess. Transfer to a plate and set aside.

5. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the olive oil. Once hot, carefully add the chicken to the pan, presentation side down. Cook until golden brown, about 4-6min.

6. Reduce the heat to medium. Flip the pieces over and cook until the internal temperature reaches 160ºF-165ºF (7ºC-74ºC), about 4-6min. Fry in batches if needed. Transfer to a clean plate, loosely tent with foil to keep warm.

7. To make the sauce, melt the butter. Add the onions and garlic, sauté for 1min, constantly stirring to ensure the garlic does not brown.

8. Add the mushrooms, &frac12;tsp salt, and &frac14;tsp pepper. Sauté until tender, about 5min.

9. Turn the heat up to medium-high and add the Marsala wine. Cook until reduced by half, about 2min.

10. Add the chicken stock. Cook until the sauce is reduced by &frac12; (about &frac12; cup), about 5-7min.

11. Reduce the heat to medium, stir in the cream. Simmer until the sauce has thickened, about 3-5min. Season to taste with salt and pepper.

12. Add the chicken back to the pan, turn to coat and gently simmer until warmed through, about 1-2min. Garnish with chopped parsley and serve hot.
