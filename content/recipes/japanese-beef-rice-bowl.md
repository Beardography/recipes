# Japanese Beef Rice Bowl (Gyudon)
## Ingredients
- 1200ml water, divided
- 4 large eggs
- 1 yellow onion
- 1-2 green onions
- 7 oz (200g) thinly sliced beef (or bulgogi cut)
- 2 cups (420g) steamed rice
- Japanese pickled ginger (beni shoga), for garnish

### Sauce
- 200ml water
- 1/2 tsp hondashi
- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- 3 tbsp mirin
- 1/2 tbsp sugar

## Directions
### Onsen Eggs (soft-cooked eggs)
1. Bring a pot of water (1 liter) to a boil.

2. Once itâ€™s piping hot, turn the heat off. Add tap water (200ml) and give it a stir.

3. Gently lower 4 large eggs, which were kept in the fridge. Cover and let sit for about 20 minutes.

4. Take them out and let cool in a bowl (or tray) for about 5 minutes. Let sit in cold water.

### Prep Ingredients
5. Thinly slice the onion and green onions.

6. Cut the beef into bite-sized pieces.

### Gyudon
7. In a wok (or pan), add water (200ml), hondashi, soy sauce, mirin, and sugar. Stir to combine.

8. Place it over medium heat. Once it starts to boil, add the onion and give some time to cook. Once they are translucent, taste and add more sugar if necessary.

9. Add the beef and let it simmer for about 5 to 10 minutes. If there is some scummy stuff on top, skim that off.

10. Divide the rice into serving bowls. Using chopsticks (or tongs), cover the rice with the beef. Add or 2 spoonfuls of the broth on top.

11. Place onsen egg in the middle and add some pickled ginger (if using). Sprinkle on green onions. Enjoy~!
