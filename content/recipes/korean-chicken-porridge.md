# Korean Chicken Porridge
## Ingredients
- 1.8 oz (50g) carrot
- 1.8 oz (50g) zucchini
- 1 green onion (or garlic chives), for garnish
- 2 cups (420g) cooked rice
- &frac12; tbsp chicken bouillon powder
- salt and pepper, to taste
- generous pinch of toasted sesame seeds
- 1-2 jujubes (optional), for garnish
- 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil (optional)

### Broth
- 4 chicken legs & 1 chicken breast (500g) (or a whole chicken)
- 1 yellow onion
- 10 cloves garlic (or more)
- 1-2 green onions
- 3 jujubes
- 1 fresh ginseng (0.7 oz, 20g) (or Samgyetang kit, 삼계탕)
- 10 cups (2,400ml) water

## Directions
### Make Chicken Broth
1. In a large stockpot, add the chicken legs and breast, onion, garlic, and green onions, jujubes, ginseng (or Samgyetang kit), and water. Bring it to a boil over high heat.

2. Once it starts to boil, there might be some foamy stuff on top. Reduce the heat to low and skim that off. Cover and let it continue to boil over medium heat for about 40 minutes.

### Prep Vegetables and Chicken
3. Finely chop the carrot and zucchini. Thinly slice the green onion (or garlic chives).

4. Take 1 or 2 jujubes and remove the seeds. Roll it as tightly as you can and cut it into thin pieces for garnish.

5. After 40 minutes, turn the heat off. Take out the chicken from the pot and let cool. Save the ginseng for garnish but discard the rest of the ingredients. Once the chicken is cool enough to handle, shred it into bite-sized pieces.

### Make Porridge
6. In a wok (or pot), add 4 cups of broth, 2 cups of cooked rice, and the chicken. Bring it to a boil over medium heat. Keep stirring it with lots of love. Otherwise, all the rice will stick on the bottom.

7. Once it gets a little thicker, add chicken bouillon powder (1/2 tbsp). Stir to combine.

8. Add the carrot and zucchini. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Let it simmer for another 3 to 5 minutes or until it gets nice and thick.

9. Transfer it to a serving bowl. Garnish with green onion, sesame seeds, jujubes (if using), and ginseng root. Optionally, drizzle sesame oil (1 tbsp). Enjoy~!
