# Teriyaki Chicken Rice Bowl
## Ingredients
- 7oz (200g) boneless, skin-on chicken thighs
- salt and pepper, to taste
- 1 tbsp soy sauce
- &frac12; tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 tbsp mirin
- &frac12; tbsp sugar
- &frac12; tbsp minced garlic
- &frac12; grated ginger
- 1 cup steamed rice
- microgreens (or salad mix)

## Directions
1. Season the chicken thighs on both sides with salt and pepper. Set aside.

2. In a small container, add soy sauce, oyster sauce, mirin, sugar, garlic, and ginger. Mix until the sugar is completely dissolved.

3. Pat dry the chicken with paper towels.

4. Place your chicken in the air fryer, skin-side up. Cook at 355℉ (180℃) for 10min.

5. Generously brush our sauce on the chicken and flip. Cook the other side for another 5min or until the chicken is cooked through.

6. Slice the chicken pieces and place them on top of the rice.

7. Add an extra drizzle of the sauce. Serve with any greens you like.
