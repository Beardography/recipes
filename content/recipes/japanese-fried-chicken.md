# Japanese Fried Chicken (Karaage)
## Ingredients
- 1.3 lb (600g) boneless, skin-on chicken thighs (or breasts)
- potato starch (or cornstarch)
- vegetable oil, for frying
- 1-2 cherry tomatoes
- lemon wedges
- Kewpie mayonnaise
- Japanese seven spices (shichimi togarashi) (optional)

### Marinade
- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- 3 tbsp mirin
- 1 tsp sugar
- 1 tsp minced garlic
- 1 tsp grated ginger
- &frac12; cup (120ml) water
- &frac12; tsp hondashi (Japanese bonito soup stock powder)

## Directions
### Marinate Chicken
1. Cut chicken thighs into nice, big chunks.

2. In a large mixing bowl, combine soy sauce, mirin, sugar, garlic, ginger, water, and hondashi.

3. Add your chicken and gently toss together.

4. Cover and let it marinate in the refrigerator for 30min or overnight.

### Coat Chicken and Double-Fry
5. Put the chicken in a strainer and let them drain.

6. Take out a tray and add a good amount of potato starch (or cornstarch). Add a splash of water (about 2 tbsp) and using a fork, mix and sort of press it down. If it creates a little bit of lumps, you are good to go.

7. Grab a piece of chicken and dredge in the potato starch. Make sure you coat it all over and let sit on a wire rack for 5min.

8. Heat up the oil to 340℉ (170℃). Once it reaches the temperature, carefully add in your chicken and fry for 2-3min. Work in 2 or 3 batches.

9. Once they get crispy on the outside, remove them from the oil and let cool on a wire rack for 1min. Add your chicken back into the oil and fry for another minute or until golden brown.

### Assemble
10. Remove the chicken from the oil and drain on the wire rack. Nicely place them on a serving plate along with some cabbage (with the dressing), cherry tomatoes, and lemon wedges.

11. Garnish with kewpie mayo and Japanese seven spice (if using). If you’re not a big fan of kewpie mayo, sprinkle some salt instead. It can be a side dish, main dish, or even appetizer.
