- 1&frac12; cups light brown sugar
- &frac12; cup granulated sugar
- 2 large eggs at room temperature
- 1 large egg yolk at room temperature
- 2 tsp pure vanilla extract
- 2&frac13; cups all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking soda
- 1 tsp ground cinnamon
- &frac12; tsp salt
- 2 cups old-fashioned oats

## Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350ÂºF

3. In a large bowl using a whisk, beat together the browned butter and both sugars until well combined, about 2min

4. Whisk in the eggs and yolk then whisk in the vanilla.

5. In a separate large bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, salt, oats, coconut, pecans, and chocolate chips

6. Fold the dry ingredients into the wet ingredients, mixing just until combined

7. Scoop 2in balls of cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheets, leaving 2in between each ball

8. Bake one sheet at a time, in preheated oven for 12min, or until cookies are golden and set at the edges and still slightly soft in the center.

10. Cool cookies on baking sheet for 10 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely
