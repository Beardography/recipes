# Orange Chicken
## Ingredients
- 17oz (500g) boneless, skinless chicken breasts (or thighs)
- 4 cloves garlic
- 0.4oz (12g) ginger
- 1 red chili (optional)
- 1 orange
- vegetable oil, for frying
- generous pinch of toasted sesame seeds
- &frac12; green onion (optional)

### Marinade
- &frac12; tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp Shaoxing wine (or mirin)
- a few shakes of black pepper
- a pinch of MSG (optional)

### Orange Chicken Sauce
- &frac14; cup sugar
- &frac14; cup white vinegar
- &frac14; cup fresh orange juice
- 1&frac12; tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
- 4 tbsp store-bought orange juice
- 2 tbsp neutral-tasting oil, to coat
- slurry (1 tbsp cornstarch + 1 tbsp water)
- 1 tsp orange zest
- &frac12; tsp toasted sesame oil

### Fried Chicken Mix
- 2 cups cake flour
- 1 cup potato starch (or cornstarch)
- 1 tsp baking powder
- 1 tsp salt
- &frac12; tsp white pepper (or black pepper)

## Directions
### Prep Chicken
1. Cut the chicken into nice, big chunks. In a large mixing bowl, combine the chicken, soy sauce, shaoxing wine (or mirin), black pepper, and MSG (if using). Cover and let it marinate in the fridge for about 30min.

### Prep Fresh Ingredients
3. Finely mince the garlic and ginger. Finely chop a red chili (if using).
4. Using a zester, get orange zest (1 tsp). Cut the orange in half and squeeze out the juice (&frac14; cup).

### Make Sauce
5. In a small container, mix together sugar, white vinegar, fresh orange juice, soy sauce, oyster sauce, and store-bought orange juice.

6. In a wok (or pan), heat the oil (2 tbsp) over medium heat. Once it gets nice and hot, add the garlic, ginger, and chili (if using). Saute for 1-2min. Once the garlic just starts to go brown, add the sauce. Bring it to a boil. 

7. Prepare the cornstarch slurry. Once it comes to a boil, add the slurry. Immediately stir it until the sauce is thickened. Turn the heat off. Add the orange zest and sesame oil (&frac12; tsp). Stir to combine. Set aside.

### Fry Chicken
8. In a large mixing bowl, whisk together cake flour, potato starch (or cornstarch), baking powder, salt, and white pepper (or black pepper). In a separate bowl, combine our fried chicken mix (1 cup) and water (1 cup).

9. Coat the chicken. Put them in the dry batter, dip into the wet batter, and back into the dry batter. Once they’re well coated, set aside.

10. Fill your wok (or pot) with enough oil. Heat it to 340℉ (170℃). Once it reaches the temperature, gently add in your chicken, and fry for about 3-4min. Do this in batches.

11. Remove them from the oil and drain on a wire rack. Bring your oil back up to 340℉ (170℃). Fry for about 2min or until light golden brown. Take them out and let rest on a wire rack.

12. Bring the sauce to a boil. Once it starts bubbling, add all your chicken. Quickly stir-fry for 30sec. 

13. Transfer it to a serving plate. Sprinkle on the sesame seeds and green onion (if using). It’s great as it is but if you could, serve with some carbs like chow mein or a bowl of hot rice. Enjoy~!
