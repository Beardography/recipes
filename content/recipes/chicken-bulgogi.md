# Chicken Bulgogi (Korean BBQ Chicken)
## Ingredients
- 1-2 green onions 
- &frac12; yellow onion
- 2-3 Korean dried chilies (or Pepperoncino, Vietnamese dried chili, etc.)
- 1.3 lb (600g) boneless, skinless chicken thighs (or breasts)
- 2 tbsp neutral-tasting oil
- generous pinch of toasted sesame seeds

### Marinade
- 3 tbsp soy sauce
- 1 tbsp oyster sauce
- 1 tbsp sugar
- 2 tbsp mirin
- 1 tbsp light corn syrup
- 1 tbsp minced garlic
- 1 tbsp toasted sesame oil
- a few shakes of black pepper

## Directions
### Prep Ingredients
1. Cut the green onions into bite-sized pieces. Cut the onion into thin slices. 

2. Cut the dried chilies into nice, big chunks. (If you use Pepperoncino or Vietnamese dried chili, you can skip this step.)

3. Cut the chicken into bite-sized pieces. Set aside.

### Marinate Chicken
4. In a large mixing bowl, mix together soy sauce, oyster sauce, sugar, mirin, corn syrup, garlic, sesame oil, and black pepper.

5. Add the chicken and gently massage it. Cover and let it sit in the fridge for at least 30min.

### Cooking
6. In a wok (or pan), heat the oil (2 tbsp) over medium heat. Once it gets nice and hot, add the green onions (save some for garnish) and make some green onion oil. Add the dried chilies and stir this around for 1min.

7. Remove the chicken from the marinade and add it to the pan. Increase the heat to high and cook for a couple of minutes.

8. Once the chicken is just about done, add your onion and toss together for about 1min. Transfer it to a serving plate. Garnish with some green onions and sesame seeds. Enjoy~!
